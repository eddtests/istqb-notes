# Testing Process

The stages of the STLC from planning through to the exit criteria and reporting.

## Test Planning, Monitoring, and Control

For each test level, test planning starts at the initiation of the test process and continues throughout the project until the completion of closure activities for that level. It involved identifying the activities and resources required to meet the mission and objectives identified in the test strategy. Test planning also includes identifying and collecting metrics that will be used to guide the project and check it was successful at the end. By determining metrics at the beginning, tools can be selected, training administered, and documentation guidelines established.

## Test Analysis

## Test Design

## Test Implementation

## Test Execution

## Evaluating Exit Criteria and Reporting

The frequency and detail required for exit criteria reporting should be negotiated during the test planning phase including consultation with all significant stakeholders. 

It is important that effective processes are in place to provide the source information necessary for evaluating exit criteria and reporting. 

Definition of the information requirements and methods for collection are part of test planning, monitoring, and control. During test analysis, test design, test implementation, and test execution, the Test Manager should ensure that members of the test team responsible for those activities are providing the information required in an accurate and timely manner to facilitate effective evaluation and reporting. 

## Test Closure Activities

These tasks should be explicitly included in any test plan. On projects carried out under contract, such as custom development, the contract should specify the tasks required. 

### Test Completion Check

All test work has been completed:
* All tests ran or deliberately skipped
* All known defects are:
  * Fixed and have passed confirmation testing
  * Deferred to a future version
  * Acknowledged as a known restriction
  
### Test Artifacts Handover

Work products should be given to those who need them:
* A list of defects handed to the support team
* Tests and test environments passed to those responsible for maintenance testing
* Regression test sets (automated and manual) should be handed to the maintenance team

### Retrospective

Lessons learned across the STLC and SDLC to ensure good practices are re-used and bad practices are avoided. 
* Was the user representation in the quality risk analysis sessions a broad enough cross-section?
* Were the estimates correct?
* What are the trends and the results of cause and effect analysis of the defects?
* Are there potential process improvement opportunities?
* Were there any unanticipated variances from the plan that should be accommodated in future planning?

### Archiving

* Archive results, logs, reports, and other work products in the configuration management system
* Ensure there's a clear link between artifacts and the system/version they were tested on
