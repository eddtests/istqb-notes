# Testing Process

## Test Planning, Monitoring, and Control

For each test level, test planning starts at the initiation of the test process and continues throughout the project until the completion of closure activities for that level. It involved identifying the activities and resources required to meet the mission and objectives identified in the test strategy. Test planning also includes identifying and collecting metrics that will be used to guide the project and check it was successful at the end. By determining metrics at the beginning, tools can be selected, training administered, and documentation guidelines established.
